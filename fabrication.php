	In our fabrication workshop we essentially manufacture steel Bobbins and Reels. These bobbins have various end use; they are used for work in progress material handling as well as finished goods packing.</p>

<p>Lately, Steel Bobbins are rapidly replacing wooden ones as the preferred packing material as they do not get damaged easily and can be re-used by the customer for either work in progress or for repackaging.</p>

<p>Equipped with the latest facility and an experienced team, we can cater to accurate fabrication and dynamic balancing of the bobbins making it suitable for high-speed applications.</p>

<p>Our facility allows us to manufacture high-speed balanced bobbins of flange sizes upto 1250mm. However non-dynamically balanced drums, generally used for packaging, can be manufactured in higher sizes as well suiting customer's requirement.</p>

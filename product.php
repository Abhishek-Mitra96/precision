                        Skipper's Steel Poles are used extensively for Power Distribution & Lighting projects in India (RGGVY and APDRP) as well as Gulf & African countries. Poles are supplied as painted or galvanized as per project requirements.
Our wide selection of commercial poles comprises Tubular Swaged poles, High Mast Poles and Octagonal poles. Our product value chain begins with the procurement of Hot Rolled Coils, confirming to IS : 10748 / IS : 5986 or equivalent standards which are then, either used as inputs for the manufacture of Steel Tubes and subsequently for Swaged Poles, or straight away slit and cut to size for manufacture of High Mast / Octagonal Poles. The 14 metre long Galvanizing unit (one of the largest in India) ensures that all sizes of Poles & Structures can be galvanized in a single dip, thereby eliminating double-dipping and zinc marks.
Our product versatility allows architects, engineers and design professionals to use them for a wide range of commercial, residential, municipal and industrial applications. The durability and strength of the product, along with its lightweight, maintenance-free construction results in minimum installation time and lower shipping cost. Each phase of design, fabrication, finishing and delivery is planned and seamlessly carried out to ensure that customers receive the highest quality products.
